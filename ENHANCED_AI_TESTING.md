## Enhanced AI Detection Testing

Test the new auto-detection feature with these examples:

### Format Examples to Try:

1. **Simple formats:**
   - "bench press 3x10 @ 135"
   - "squats 225 lbs 5x5" 
   - "deadlift 4 sets of 6 reps at 315 pounds"

2. **Casual formats:**
   - "did some pushups 3 sets 15 reps"
   - "ran 3 miles for 30 minutes"
   - "bicep curls 3x12 with 25 pound dumbbells"

3. **Compound formats:**
   - "bench press 3x8 @ 185 lbs with 2 minute rest"
   - "back squats 5 sets of 5 reps at 225 pounds"
   - "overhead press 4x8 @ 95"

### Expected Behavior:

1. **Auto-population:** Sets, reps, and weight should auto-fill when detected
2. **AI Suggestions:** Enhanced suggestions showing detected values
3. **Manual Override:** Users can still manually adjust any values
4. **Fallback:** If detection fails, manual input still works

### Testing Steps:

1. Type an exercise with format like "bench press 3x10 @ 135"
2. Wait 1 second for AI detection
3. Check if suggestion shows detected sets/reps/weight
4. Click "Accept All Suggestions" to auto-fill
5. Submit the workout log

The AI should extract:
- Exercise name: "Bench Press"  
- Category: "CHEST"
- Sets: 3
- Reps: 10  
- Weight: 135
